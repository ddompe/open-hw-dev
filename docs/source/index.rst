Welcome to Open Hardware Tutorial's documentation!
==================================================

This documentation elaborates on the environment used by the Open Hardware
tutorial created for one of the `IEEE LASCAS 2020 workshops <http://www.ie.tec.ac.cr/lascas2020/>`_.

The tutorial aims to provide ways to leverage Open Source components and knowledge
to improve the development of Open Hardware. This repository and documentation
provide a working example of several technologies:

- A reproducible development environment based on Vagrant and Docker
- A Documentation system based on Sphinx and ReadtheDocs
- A Continuous Integration system based on GitHub and CircleCI
